          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I live in Portland, Oregon. I have two <strong>very cute</strong> pups that I love to spend my time with. I like walking in pretty places, dancing, gardening, and bike rides. I listen to a lot of podcasts and join an utterly unsustainable amount of book clubs. I have more plants than I know what to do with, but I'll likely still have a new one next week. My hair will probably be a different color next time you see me.</p>

          <h2>Why Learn Code?</h2>
          <p>Learning to program has been a long time coming for me. I love pulling things apart, figuring out how they work, and putting them back together. I started building, troubleshooting, and fixing computers and other electronics in college, but I've always worked with hardware and physical objects. I'm excited to begin applying my love of tinkering and problem solving to code.</p>
